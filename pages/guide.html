            Every day, a home might waste many litres of fresh water - and let energy fly out of the window. But
            there's no need to flush your money down the drain. You can look at your household habits in a different
            way to both cut your utility bills and to reduce the strain on precious resources.

                <div class="head-title my-2">Saving energy is saving money</div>
                <p class="small-text my-5">You can use less energy - and cut your bills - with a fresh look at your lighting, heating and home
                    appliances.
                    <br><br>
                    LED light bulbs, for example, use up to 85% less energy and last 20 times longer than incandescent
                    bulbs. You save even more if you turn them off as you leave the room (so simple with the TRÃ…DFRI
                    remote control). To easily lower your heating costs, you can use insulating blinds or thicker
                    curtains when the temperature drops.
                    <br><br>
                    What about that power-hungry tumble dryer? When you can drip-dry on a rack instead, your clothes
                    suffer less wear-and-tear into the bargain.
                    <br><br>
                    Of course, electrical appliances are modern-day essentials but the newer models, rated AA+ or
                    higher, are very energy efficient. And, if you want to think big, home solar can reduce your
                    electricity payments, as well as your carbon emissions.</p>

                <div class="head-title my-2">How to use less water - without even trying</div>
                <p class="small-text my-5">Of all the water in the world, less than 3% is fresh. So, the careful use of
                    it makes sense - financially and environmentally. Happily, some modern products can do the
                    water-saving for you.
                    <br><br>
                    For example, a pressure-compensating aerator is standard across the whole IKEA range of taps and
                    showers. This reduces the amount of water coming out - by up to 50% in some bathroom taps - but
                    keeps the flow at the level you want. So, you use less energy to heat it, even more when the tap has
                    a cold-start function.
                    <br><br>
                    Today's dishwashers and washing machines usually have an 'eco mode' option that's highly water- and
                    energy-efficient. In fact, a fully-laden dishwasher on this setting will use less water than if you
                    were to do it all by hand.</p>

                <div class="head-title my-2">Save some for the plants, too</div>
                <p class="small-text my-5">A typical home can save many litres of water each day, simply by turning off
                    the tap while you brush your teeth. Or by washing your salad in a bowl instead of under running
                    water. You can then give this water to your houseplants. And while you wait for the shower to warm
                    up, you can collect the water for the same purpose.

                    Fresh water may be an expensive resource - but rainwater is free to collect for use on your garden.
                    (If you wait until sunset, you lose less water through evaporation.)

                    In warmer weather, you can chill your tap water in the fridge so that you don't have to run the tap
                    to cool down first. Of course, not everyone in the world has drinkable water on tap. So, perhaps
                    those of us that do ought to value every last drop.</p>
